# Simple PokeOne Bot

This is a Simple Bot for PokeOne, expect not to much, this is only a Pixel Based Bot for Shiny Hunting or Lazy Leveling.

PokeONE need to be always in Focus & Top because it Send Key Inputs for Walking and need to see the Window to Detect Screen Positions for Bot States.


Features:

- Shiny Hunting (only for Wild Encounters)
- EXP Farming ( it just use the Moves 1-4 and Auto Switch the Pokemon, if u have no Pokemon Left the Bot will Stop).


HotKeys:

- F5 Start
- F6 Pause
- F7 Panic/Close Bot

(HotKeys can be changed in the Settings.ini in the Directory).

This Bot is just a maybe 1h Project, there will be in Future better Bots via TCP Packets or something, u can just use it now for waiting for a better Bot :)

Repository will get Updates and Fixes when i have Time, i  personally use it for Shiny Hunting only atm.
