# Simple PokeOne Bot

This is a Simple Bot for PokeOne, expect not to much, this is only a Pixel Based Bot for Shiny Hunting or Lazy Leveling.


Important Notes:

- PokeONE need to be on 800x600 Resolition.
- PokeOne need to be always in Top/Focus for Sending Keys and Scanning the Screen.
- Use the Bot for your own Risk, botting is not allowed in This Game and could result a Ban.
- I am not responsible if you get banned.


Features:

- Shiny Hunting (Wild and Fishing Encounters)
- EXP Farming ( it just use the Moves 1-4 and Auto Switch the Pokemon, if u have no Pokemon Left the Bot will Stop).
- Live Encounter Display for OBS or other.


HotKeys:

- F5 Start
- F6 Pause
- F7 Panic/Close Bot

(HotKeys can be changed in the Settings.ini in the Directory).

Have Fun, if you like the Game Support them with a Donation or Buy Lootboxes :)
